# Project: Income Classification 


## Context:  
- We have a dataset about the income as well as some related information of citizens from different countries. 
- Link to download dataset:
  kaggle competitions download -c ml-hands-on-python-kaggle-01
- This data consists of 25000 rows and 16 columns. The information of each citizen is presented by a row in the dataframe. Columns show the information of age, work type, education, marital state, ethnicity, job, hours per week, ...
- The purpose of this project is to predict if the income of a person is over 50K or not. 

Through this project, we discover some important techniques for data prepocessing as:
 - Data cleaning 
 - Feature engineering (encoding categorical columns)
 - Data balancing (by random oversampling techinque)

Then, multiple machine learning algorithms are applied for this classification problem, including:
  + Support Vector Machine 
  + K-nearest neighbors
  + Linear Discriminant Analysis
  + Decision Tree
  + Naive Bayes Classifier 
  + Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier
  + Random Forest
  + Gradient Boosting Classifier 
  + AdaBoost Classifier
  + XGBoost Classifier
  + Histogram-based Boosting Classifier
  + LightBoost Classifier
  + CatBoost Classifier 
  





A various machine learning algorithms are apppied for this classification problem
