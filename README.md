# Project: Income Classification 


## Context:  
- We have a dataset about the income as well as some related information of citizens from different countries.

  ```
- This data consists of 25000 rows and 16 columns. The information of each citizen is presented by a row in the dataframe. Columns show the information of age, work type, education, marital state, ethnicity, job, hours per week, ...
- The purpose of this project is to predict if the income of a person is over 50K or not. 

Through this project, we discover some important techniques for data prepocessing as:
 - Data cleaning 
 - Feature engineering
 - Principle component analysis
 - Data balancing

Then, multiple machine learning algorithms are applied for this classification problem, including:
  + Support Vector Machine
  + K-nearest neighbors 
  + Linear Discriminant Analysis 
  + Decision Tree classifier 
  + Naive Bayes classifier 
  + Stochastic Gradient Descent classifier 
  + Random Forest classifier
  + Gradient Boosting Classifier 
  + AdaBoost Classifier
  + XGBoost Classifier
  + Histogram-based Boosting Classifier
  + LightBoost Classifier
  + CatBoost Classifier
